<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The game we are developing can be specified as follows::<br>
    There is a fixed target in the center of the playing field.<br>
    The player uses the keyboard to move the gun sight to the center of the target.<br>
    After aiming, the player presses the button and thus makes a shot.<br>
    The closer the gunshot to the center of the target, the more points the player gets.<br>
    The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible in a limited number of attempts.<br>
    Also, we will add some special effects to decrease shooting precision.<br>
</p>

<p>A possible version of the complete game demonstrates in the following figure.

</p>

<br>
<p>In this stage, we will create a game field and graphical objects.</p>
<p>You will construct three graphical objects:
<li><code>Target</code> is a family of concentric circles. The <code>Target</code> always stays still.</li>
<li><code>Gun Sight</code> indicates the location of the intended shot.</li>
<li><code>Hole of Bullet</code> points a traces of gunfire. They will appear as the shots happen.</li>
</p>

<br>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create the main window of the program with two parts:
<li><code>Statusbar</code> - JLabel. Due to testing reasons, you need to set the name <code>Statusbar</code> to it.<br>
The <code>Statusbar</code> is intended to inform the player and must contain some text.
</li>
<li><code>Canvas</code> - extends JPanel. Due to testing reasons, you need to set the name <code>Canvas</code> to it.<br>
The <code>Canvas</code> should be in focus.
</li>
</p>

<br>
<p>You should draw the <code>Target</code> on the <code>Canvas</code> with the following requirements:
<img src="Example1.png">
<li><code>The center point</code> of the <code>Target</code> should be at <code>(350, 350)</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>Target</code> should contain ten concentric circles with incrementing of radius in 30 pixels.</li>
<li>The colors of the circles should be <code>Color.BLACK</code> and <code>Color.WHITE</code>, and alternate as shown in <i>Example 1</i>.</li>
<li>The background color of the <code>Target</code> should be <code>Color.DARK_GRAY</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>Target</code> should be fully inserted into the <code>Canvas</code> without clipping.</li>
</p>

<br>
<p>You should draw the <code>Bullet hole</code> on the <code>Canvas</code> <u>with the center</u> at the point <code>(300, 500)</code>
with a color different from <code>Color.BLACK</code>, <code>Color.WHITE</code>, <code>Color.DARK_GRAY</code>.
You can define the size of the <code>Bullet hole</code> on your own. As an option, it may be a circle with a radius of 5 pixels.
</p>

<br>
<p>You can draw the <code>Gun Sight</code> at your discretion.</p>

<p>As a result, you should have something like in <i>Example 1.</i></p>
