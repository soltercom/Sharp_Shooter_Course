<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this project, we will develop a shooting simulator.</p>
<p>Game description:<br>
    There is a fixed target in the center of the playing field.<br>
    The player uses the keyboard to move the gun sight to the center of the target.<br>
    After aiming, the player presses the button and thus makes a shot.<br>
    The closer the gunshot to the center of the target, the more points the player gets.<br>
    The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible in a limited number of attempts.<br>
    Also, we will add some special effects to decrease shooting precision.<br>
</p>

<p>An example of the game demonstrates in figure <b>Example 1.</b></p>

<p>In this stage, we will create a game field and graphical objects.</p>
<p>You will construct three graphical objects:
<li><b>Target</b> is a family of concentric circles. The <b>Target</b> always stays still.</li>
<li><b>Gun Sight</b> indicates the location of the intended shot.</li>
<li><b>Hole of Bullet</b> points a traces of gunfire. They will appear as the shots happen.</li>
</p>

<br>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create the main window of the program with two parts:
<li><b>Statusbar</b> - JLabel. Due to testing reasons, you need to set the name <b>Statusbar</b> to it.<br>
The <b>Statusbar</b> is intended to inform the player and must contain some text.
</li>
<li><b>Canvas</b> - extends JPanel. Due to testing reasons, you need to set the name <b>Canvas</b> to it.<br>
The <b>Canvas</b> should be in focus.
</li>
</p>

<br>
<p>You should draw the <b>Target</b> on the <b>Canvas</b> with the following requirements:
<li><b>The center point</b> of the <b>Target</b> should be at <b>(350, 350).</b></li>
<li>The <b>Target</b> should contain ten concentric circles with incrementing of radius in 30 pixels.</li>
<li>The colors of the circles should be <i>Color.BLACK</i> and <i>Color.WHITE</i>, and alternate as shown in <b>Example 2</b>.</li>
<li>The background color of the <b>Target</b> should be Color.DARK_GRAY.</li>
</p>

<br>
<p>You should draw the <b>Bullet hole</b> on the <b>Canvas</b> <u>with the center</u> at the point <b>(300, 500)</b>
with a color different from Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE, Color.DARK_GRAY.</p>

<br>
<p>You can draw the <b>Gun Sight</b> at your discretion.</p>
