<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s add some logic to our program.<br>
    The scenario of our game is in the following figure.
    <br>
    <img  src="Figure 3_1.png">
    <br>
    The game comprises three stages:
    <ul>
        <li><code>START</code> At this stage, we prepare all required variables
            (for instance, the <code>Number of attempts</code>) and game screen, block movements of the <code>Gun Sight</code>.
            Go to the next level after pressing the <code>SPACE</code> button.</li>
        <li><code>GAME</code> Gameplay starts: listen to keyboard events and move the <code>Gun Sight</code>.
            After each pressing on the <code>SPACE</code> button, add the <code>Bullet Hole</code> on the <code>Canvas</code>
            and decrement the <code>Number of attempts</code> variable.
            When the <code>Number of attempts</code> reaches zero, we move to the next stage.
        </li>
        <li><code>END</code> Gameplay stops: block movements of the <code>Gun Sight</code>
            and creation of the new <code>Bullet Hole</code>. Put the final result on the screen.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Speaking of results, we need to measure the shooting accuracy.
    It is logical to assume that the closer you get to the center of the target, the higher the reward.
    Accordingly, a hit in the central circle score 10 points, and an outer circle gives 1 point.
    The other circles give in inverse proportion to their distance from the center.
    The current information is displayed on the <code>Statusbar</code>.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>
    There are 12 attempts.
    The requirements of constructing graphical objects remain the same as in previous tasks.
    For testing purposes, the initial position of the <code>Gun Sight</code> should be at the center of the <code>Target</code>.
    You should display the information about the game state in the <code>Statusbar</code>, as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>At the <code>START</code>, it contains text <code>Press SPACE button to start the game</code>. </li>
        <li>During the <code>GAME</code>, it contains <code>Shootings left: {1}, your score: {2}</code>.
            Where {1} - number of remaining attempts, {2} - total score.</li>
        <li>At the <code>END</code>, it contains <code>Game over, your score: {1}. Where {1} - total score.</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>
