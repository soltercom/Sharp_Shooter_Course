<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    There are a couple of ideas on how to improve our program.
</p>
<p>
    First, in the real world, objects move due to the laws of physics.
    Generally, it is a movement with acceleration, not linear.
    In the physical world, objects don’t start or stop instantaneously.
    Instead, they take time to speed up and slow down.
    The following figure shows the difference between the characteristics of motion in our program
    and movement with acceleration.

    So far in our program, when we move the <code>Gun Sight</code>, for instance, to the right,
    we increase the horizontal coordinate once <code>(x += 10)</code> and update the screen.
    But to simulate accelerated motion, we have to change this algorithm.
    We should create a sequence of changes to the horizontal variable, for instance, <code>(1, 2, 4, 2, 1)</code>.
    For each element of this collection, we should do the following operations:
    <ul>
        <li><code>x += 10;</code></li>
        <li><code>update screen;</code></li>
    </ul>
    I hope the idea is clear.
</p>
<p>
    Second, in real life, it is not so easy to hit a target.
    Hands are shaking, the wind blows, gun defective.
    It is all the work of some forces.
    Under Newton’s second law, force produces motion with acceleration.
    That is, you can apply the algorithm discussed above.
</p>
<p>
    We have considered one of a million options that we can use, so it is up to you to choose.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
    The requirements of constructing graphical objects remain the same as in previous stages.<br>
    For testing purposes, the initial position of the center of the <code>Gun Sight</code> should be at the point <code>(100, 100)</code>.<br>
    The main task is to make the accuracy of shooting as hard as possible.
